# What is a vector database?
A vector database is a **type of database** that stores data as **high-dimensional vectors**, which are mathematical representations of features or attributes.

## How are they generated
 The **vectors are usually generated by applying some kind of transformation** or embedding function to the raw data, such as text, images, audio, video, and others. The embedding function can be based on various methods, such as machine learning models, word embeddings, feature extraction algorithms.

## Main advantage comapred to other databases
The main advantage of a vector database is that **it allows for fast and accurate similarity search and retrieval of data based on their vector distance or similarity.** This means that instead of using traditional methods of querying databases based on exact matches or predefined criteria, you can use a vector database to find the most similar or relevant data based on their semantic or contextual meaning.

## Use cases for vector database
One use case for storing information in a vector database is to enable large language models (LLMs) to generate more relevant and coherent text based on an AI plugin.

## How its used to improve LLM (ML, NLP and more)
you can use a large language model and pass information from the vector database with your AI plugin to generate more informative and engaging content that matches your intent and style.
